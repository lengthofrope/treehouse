# STUB: Stub Status and Validation

## Key File Mappings
- `src/App/Controllers/HomeController.php` ↔ `resources/stubs/new-project/src/App/Controllers/HomeController.php`
- `src/App/Models/User.php` ↔ `resources/stubs/new-project/src/App/Models/User.php`
- `config/app.php` ↔ `resources/stubs/new-project/config/app.php`
- `config/auth.php` ↔ `resources/stubs/new-project/config/auth.php`
- `config/cache.php` ↔ `resources/stubs/new-project/config/cache.php`
- `config/database.php` ↔ `resources/stubs/new-project/config/database.php`
- `config/view.php` ↔ `resources/stubs/new-project/config/view.php`
- `config/routes/web.php` ↔ `resources/stubs/new-project/config/routes/web.php`
- `public/.htaccess` ↔ `resources/stubs/new-project/public/.htaccess`
- `public/index.php` ↔ `resources/stubs/new-project/public/index.php`

## Validation Rules
- Files must have identical content (excluding comments with timestamps)
- Namespace declarations must match framework structure
- Class names and methods must be identical
- Dependencies and imports must align

## Auto-Update Triggers
- When main framework files change → validate stub sync
- Before creating new projects → ensure stubs are current
- During memory bank updates → check stub consistency
- Git pre-commit hooks → validate stub status

## Status Tracking
Last validated: 2025-06-28 14:39:00
Sync status: SYNCHRONIZED_WITH_INTENTIONAL_DIFFERENCES
Out-of-sync files: NONE

## Synchronized Files
- src/App/Models/User.php ✓ (now includes full authorization features)
- src/App/Controllers/HomeController.php ✓
- config/auth.php ✓ (full role-based authorization config)
- config/cache.php ✓
- config/database.php ✓
- config/view.php ✓
- config/routes/web.php ✓

## Intentional Differences (Preserved)
- config/app.php (stub: {{PROJECT_NAME}} placeholder, debug=false, error logging vs main: TreeHouse Framework, debug=true, debug logging)

## Sync Actions Completed
1. ✅ Updated User model to include AuthorizableUser trait and authorization capabilities
2. ✅ Synchronized all config files while preserving project-appropriate defaults
3. ✅ Maintained placeholder system for new project creation
4. ✅ Verified core functionality alignment between main and stub

## Current Status: HEALTHY
All core functionality is synchronized. Remaining differences are intentional and appropriate for new project templates.
