# TreeHouse Framework - Product Description

## What TreeHouse Is
TreeHouse is a **zero-dependency PHP web framework** built entirely from scratch using pure PHP 8.4+. It provides developers with a comprehensive, self-contained web development solution that eliminates the complexity and security risks associated with external dependencies.

## Problems It Solves

### 1. **Dependency Bloat & Security Risks**
- Modern PHP frameworks often require dozens of external packages, creating maintenance overhead and security vulnerabilities
- TreeHouse eliminates this by providing all functionality in a single, self-contained package

### 2. **Framework Complexity**
- Many frameworks have steep learning curves and complex abstractions
- TreeHouse offers familiar patterns (Laravel-inspired) with simpler, more transparent implementations

### 3. **Production Deployment Challenges**
- External dependencies can cause version conflicts and deployment issues
- TreeHouse ensures consistent behavior across environments with zero external dependencies

### 4. **Limited Control Over Framework Internals**
- Developers often can't modify core framework behavior without complex workarounds
- TreeHouse provides full access to all source code for complete customization

## How It Works

### **Core Architecture**
- **Foundation Layer**: Application container, dependency injection, configuration management
- **Database Layer**: ActiveRecord ORM with relationships, query builder, migrations
- **Router Layer**: URL routing, middleware support, request/response handling
- **Auth Layer**: Role-based access control (RBAC), authentication guards, permissions
- **View Layer**: Custom templating engine with HTML-valid syntax
- **Console Layer**: Comprehensive CLI tool for development tasks
- **Security Layer**: CSRF protection, encryption, password hashing, input sanitization
- **Validation Layer**: 25+ built-in rules with custom rule support
- **Cache Layer**: File-based caching with pattern matching

### **Development Workflow**
1. **Bootstrap**: Single `composer create-project` command sets up complete framework
2. **Development**: Use familiar MVC patterns with ActiveRecord models, controllers, and views
3. **CLI Tools**: Rich command-line interface for database migrations, user management, cache operations
4. **Testing**: Built-in PHPUnit integration with comprehensive test coverage
5. **Deployment**: Single codebase deployment with no external dependencies to manage

## User Experience Goals

### **For Developers**
- **Familiar Patterns**: Laravel-inspired API for easy adoption
- **Zero Setup Friction**: Works immediately after installation
- **Rich CLI Experience**: Comprehensive tooling for common development tasks
- **Transparent Architecture**: Full access to source code for learning and customization
- **Security by Default**: Built-in protection against common vulnerabilities

### **For Organizations**
- **Reduced Attack Surface**: No external dependencies means fewer potential vulnerabilities
- **Predictable Deployment**: Consistent behavior across all environments
- **Lower Maintenance Overhead**: No dependency updates or security patches for external packages
- **Complete Control**: Full ownership of all framework code

### **For Projects**
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Full-featured framework enables quick proof-of-concepts
- **Scalable Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns supports growth
- **Long-term Stability**: No external dependency changes can break the application
- **Educational Value**: Clear, readable code serves as learning resource

## Target Use Cases
