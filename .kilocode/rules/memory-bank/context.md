# TreeHouse Framework - Current Context

## Project Status
**Active Development** - Framework is functional but not yet production-ready. Currently in beta phase with feature completion and stability as primary focus.

## Current Work Focus
- **Framework Stabilization**: Ensuring all core components work reliably together
- **Testing Coverage**: Comprehensive PHPUnit test suite covering all major components
- **Documentation**: Complete API documentation and usage examples
- **Performance Optimization**: Caching improvements and code optimization

## Recent Major Changes
- **ActiveRecord ORM**: Fully implemented with relationships, query builder, and model events
- **Authentication System**: Complete RBAC with roles, permissions, and policy-based authorization
- **Template Engine**: Custom templating with HTML-valid syntax and auth integration
- **CLI Framework**: Comprehensive console application with database migrations and user management
- **Dependency Injection**: Service container with automatic dependency resolution

## Architecture State
- **Foundation Layer**: ✅ Complete - Application container, DI, configuration management
- **Database Layer**: ✅ Complete - ActiveRecord, QueryBuilder, migrations, relationships
- **Router Layer**: ✅ Complete - URL routing, middleware, request/response handling
- **Auth Layer**: ✅ Complete - RBAC, guards, permissions, policies
- **View Layer**: ✅ Complete - Template engine with caching and compilation
- **Console Layer**: ✅ Complete - CLI framework with commands and helpers
- **Security Layer**: ✅ Complete - CSRF, encryption, hashing, sanitization
- **Validation Layer**: ✅ Complete - 25+ rules with custom rule support
- **Cache Layer**: ✅ Complete - File-based caching with pattern matching

## Current Technical State
- **PHP Version**: 8.4+ (utilizing modern PHP features)
- **Zero Dependencies**: Only requires PHP extensions (PDO, JSON, mbstring, OpenSSL, fileinfo, filter)
- **PSR-4 Autoloading**: Organized namespace structure under `LengthOfRope\TreeHouse`
- **Testing**: PHPUnit 11.0+ with comprehensive test coverage
- **Code Quality**: Strict typing, modern PHP patterns, comprehensive documentation

## Next Steps
1. **Production Readiness**: Final testing and bug fixes for stable release
2. **Performance Benchmarking**: Compare against Laravel, Symfony for performance metrics
3. **Documentation**: Complete user guides, API reference, and tutorials
4. **Community**: Prepare for open-source release with contribution guidelines

## Known Issues
- Some edge cases in relationship loading may need optimization
- Cache invalidation patterns could be enhanced
- CLI commands may need additional validation
